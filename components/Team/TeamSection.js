            For the first time, Karangwa Hirwa Julien saw a computer early in the 2000s. He wanted to know what was in that box that his father was using. He played a game for the first time on it, got addicted to it, and it led him to skip classes in primary school because He was going to a cyber cafe.<br /><br />
            Changed locations in Rwanda, but something was always missing in Karangwa's life. Apart from using his friends' computers and gaining skills while others couldn't understand why. He was also trying to search for his laptop. Luckily in 2016, her sister got a 32GB laptop gift from their aunt. And that was the start of his journey since He was using his sister's laptop. <br /><br />
            Karangwa Hirwa Julien is a self-taught software engineer with more than five years in software engineering. He has worked in different areas of the industry, such as in health, government institutions, Tourism, travel systems, etc.<br /><br />
            Since then, Karangwa Hirwa Julien has never stopped working towards his dreams. He says: "I am going to change what can change around me."

                Being a friend of orphans has made me be one of them in one way or another. I think having no one around does not mean you can not be with someone, and that is why I am always ready to change what's coming my way if it needs a change of course.
